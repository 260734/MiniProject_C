# Introduction
* The game of Tic Tac Toe is often the first paper-and-pencil game played by small children. It introduces the basic elements of a two-player game, with a small set of easy rules, clear objectives, and clearly identified turns. However, once Tic Tac Toe is mastered, it becomes quickly apparent that every game should result in a draw; that is, there is a clear winning strategy for the first player every time. Because of its simplicity, Tic Tac Toe is often overlooked as a potential area for gaming.

# Research
* This game dates backs to the Roman empire around first century BC which was played using only three pebbles.The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative word for zero), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries. In late 90's people around the world started taking computers as their entertainment source and from that point of time gaming industry was taking its shape. So I decided to contribute towards it by developing this game which will help people to pass there free time.

# Cost and Features
* Main features of this game are that it can be played by the user any number of times. After the end of each game user is asked if he want to play it again. This game is entirely free of cost as it has no special requirements such as server hosting etc. So this is a money friendly game. Easy to understand game interface and can be played by anyone.
