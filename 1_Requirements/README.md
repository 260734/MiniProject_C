* The game of Tic Tac Toe is often the first paper-and-pencil game played by small children. It introduces the basic elements of a two-player game, with a small set of easy rules, clear objectives, and clearly identified turns. However, once Tic Tac Toe is mastered, it becomes quickly apparent that every game should result in a draw; that is, there is a clear winning strategy for the first player every time. Because of its simplicity, Tic Tac Toe is often overlooked as a potential area for gaming.
